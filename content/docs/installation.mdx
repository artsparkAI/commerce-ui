This project is built with **Next.js**, using **TypeScript** and **Tailwind CSS** for all components. Some components also rely on [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation) and [Motion](https://motion.dev).  



<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Install Tailwind CSS

    The components are styled using **Tailwind CSS**.  
    Follow the official [installation guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) to set it up in your project.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Install Motion

    To use components with animations, youâ€™ll need to add **Motion** to your project.

    <InstallTabs items={['npm', 'pnpm', 'bun']}>
    ```bash tab="npm"
    npm install motion
    ```
    ```bash tab="pnpm"
    pnpm add motion
    ```
    ```bash tab="bun"
    bun add motion
    ```
    </InstallTabs>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Add a Utility Helper

    To make it easier to conditionally apply Tailwind CSS classes, add this `cn` helper function to your project.

    ```ts title="lib/utils.ts"
    import { clsx, type ClassValue } from 'clsx'
    import { twMerge } from 'tailwind-merge'

    export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
      return twMerge(clsx(inputs))
    }
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

You're good to go!
