## Overview
MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. 

We now provide a standardized way to connect AI models to components and blocks, allowing developers to build commerce applications even faster!

This will give you the ability to ask your AI-powered IDE to create components and blocks based on your requirements, making it easier to build commerce applications.

## How to use it

Once installed, you can use the MCP server to enable your AI-powered IDE to provide context to your components and blocks, making it easier to build commerce applications. 

For example, you can ask your IDE's agent the following question:
- Create a product page using star rating fractional component 
- Create a banner component similar to stackzero's banner-01.
